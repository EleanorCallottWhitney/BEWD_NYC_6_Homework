## Introduction
This is going to be very similar to how we used to be submitting homework.

## Setup

1. Go to page https://github.com/ga-students/BEWD_NYC_6_Homework
2. Fork that repository so you have your own
3. Go to your GA/BEWD directory usually `~/ga`
4. clone your fork `git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/BEWD_NYC_6_Homework.git bewd_homework`
  - Take note of the URL we are using and how we specify the name of the folder

## Submitting Homework

1. Place homework files in your username directory
2. Git workflow (git add, git commit, git push)
3. do a pull request


## Notes

- Feel free to submit your old homework as well, but it's not necessary
